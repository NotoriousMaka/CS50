Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Spain was in the first ones at the start, but as I went up it kind of disappeared from the top of the chances.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I think after 1000 simulations, the right answer comes up. I would say a thousand simulations.
